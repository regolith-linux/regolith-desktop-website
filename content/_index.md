# The Regolith Desktop Environment

![](/regolith-empty.png)

{{< columns >}}

### Productivity First

Regolith runs [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [Sway](https://swaywm.org/): popular, fast, and configurable tiling window managers that are great for productive, keyboard-driven workflows.  Regolith integrates i3 and Sway with other desktop components such as 
`i3bar`, `rofication`, `i3status-rs`, and [`ilia`](https://github.com/regolith-linux/ilia#readme) to provide a complete desktop experience.

<--->

### GNOME System Management

By integrating light-weight window managers with `gnome-session`, Regolith sidesteps
much of the complexity of a typical `gnome-shell` based environment while providing
simple and consistent system management capabilities.
