## Regolith 3.2 Release Notes

Regolith 3.2 is a minor release focusing on Ubuntu 24.04 support, init system overhaul, and bug fixes.

### Features

* Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) support
* `regolith-control-center` rebased from GNOME 46 (for supported releases)
* Sway session promoted from `beta` to `stable` status
* Overhaul of X11 and Wayland session initialization

### Deprecations

* Deprecating support for the following OS releases:
    * Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
    * Debian 11 (Bullseye)
* Deprecating support for Wayland session on Debian 12 (Bookworm) due to out-of-date build dependencies
* `regolith-control-center` has *not* been ported to GNOME 47 and so users on Ubuntu 24.10 will need to use `gnome-control-center` instead.


### Installation Instructions

For those using the `release-3_1` `apt` URL, update it to `release-3_2` and update your packages with `apt update` or similiar.  

For those using the "rolling" release label `release-current`, no change is necessary to get the update.

After `apt upgrade` is complete, verify that Regolith 3.2 is installed by:

```shell
$ cat /etc/regolith/version 
REGOLITH_VERSION=3.2
```

Note: A reboot is required for the new version to load.
