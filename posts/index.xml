It&amp;rsquo;s been a longer release cycle than hoped, as many users are wanting to run Regolith on the latest Ubuntu LTS: Noble. In this release, the items that come to mind that required more time than expected were the systemd init refactoring and integration of GNOME 46. Soumya initiated the effort to clean up and make our init code generally consistent with systemd, cleaning up some rather old ad-hoc shell script init code.</description></item><item><title>Package URL change for 2.1</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/posts/repo-url-change-2.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/posts/repo-url-change-2.1/</guid><description>Summary # For the Regolith 2.1 release, the host name of the URL from which apt pulls packages has changed.

This change came into Regolith with the inclusion of GNOME 45 into Ubuntu Mantic. It looks like we&amp;rsquo;re getting some help from upstream, but it may be some time until we&amp;rsquo;re able to support GNOME 45-based distros if the solution ends up being that we need to implement our own portal backend to coexist with GNOME&amp;rsquo;s backend.</description></item><item><title>Foundations for Regolith on Wayland (GSoC'22)</title><link>https://regolith-desktop.com/posts/sway_integration_gsoc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://regolith-desktop.com/posts/sway_integration_gsoc/</guid><description>Introduction # Regolith is a modern desktop environment designed to let you work faster by reducing unnecessary clutter and ceremony.

In the past we&amp;rsquo;ve used a translation system, but it turned out to be too complex for many people to understand. For the Regolith 2.0 site we&amp;rsquo;ll rely on Hugo&amp;rsquo;s multilingual support.
For a given language translation the following files must be translated:
