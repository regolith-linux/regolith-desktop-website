This can make the first time experience a bit confusing. However using the Regolith interface is relatively simple by only committing the following two keybindings to memory:\n   Action Keybinding Purpose     Keybinding Viewer  super shift ?   View and execute available keybindings   App Launcher  super space   Launch a desktop application    The Super Key #  Most keybindings you\u0026rsquo;ll be using with Regolith start with the super  key. This key typically says \u0026ldquo;WIN\u0026rdquo; or has a MS Windows logo on it. On a Mac it is the Command ⌘  key. Going forward, this key will simply be referred to as super  but keep in mind that you can change which physical button super  maps to in your configuration if you choose to.\n Entering one of these keybindings will cause a launcher dialog to pop up on the focused monitor. Both of these dialogs have the same general interface:\n   The interface has a text entry widget at the top, followed by a list selection widget. The general usage pattern for these dialogs is to select an item from the displayed list. Begin typing to filter the selections, and use the arrow keys to make a selection. Pressing enter  will cause the selected item to be activated. For keybindings, this means a keybinding will be manually executed. For apps, the selected application will be launched.\nKeybinding Viewer #  The keybinding viewer\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to make finding and learning the Regolith keybindings quick and easy. A reference to the keybindings is available on this site, however it\u0026rsquo;s faster to simply bring up the dialog and search for the action you are looking for. Once found, the keybinding can be executed either with the keyboard or by selecting the item in the dialog.\nApplication Launcher #  A fundamental task of any desktop environment is to enable users to launch applications. In Regolith this is done via the app launcher dialog. As with keybindings, the dialog first shows a list of all available desktop applications. Begin typing to filter the selection and use the arrow keys to specify a specific selection. Press enter  to launch the selected application.\nNext Steps #  Have a look at the basics page to learn more about the Regolith interface.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/howtos/customize-i3-configuration/","title":"Customize i3 Configuration","section":"How To","content":"How to work with Regolith 2\u0026rsquo;s defaults #  The default configurations are stored in /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d.

The new hostname is regolith-desktop.org. In order to update to Regolith 2.1 and get fixes and upgrades going forward kindly update your apt configuration.\nThe old apt URL:\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/regolith.list:\ndeb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg] https://regolith-desktop.io/release-ubuntu-jammy-amd64 testing main ^ | (this changes to '.org') The new apt URL:\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/regolith.list:\ndeb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg] https://regolith-desktop.org/release-ubuntu-jammy-amd64 testing main All other aspects of the package configuration remain the same including the key used to verify packages.\nAdditional Info #  The Regolith 2.1 release reintroduced the ISO form of distribution. In order to generate the ISO with the production apt URL the packages needed to be published first. This essentially required a way of publishing the release before we wish users to get access to the packages. In order to achieve this the idea of using a URL and switching the host seemed like a good idea. Problems occurred when the realities of TLS cert management became apparent. When the domain was remapped to the new host, the TLS certificates were not. Later, when the problem became known, the hosting provider gave advice on how to resolve the problem. However, the original source domain name (regolith-desktop.io) somehow is not able to take a new cert registration from the new host. Some remedies have been suggested by users, but due to the nature of the production host we opted to leave the system as-is and migrate to the new domain to prevent further churn for users.\nWhen the 2.1 release was published, the URL was updated to regolith-desktop.org. Users still using regolith-desktop.io will most likely be stuck on the 2.0 release unless the TLS certificate issue is ignored or in some way resolved.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/reference/configurations/","title":"Config Files","section":"Reference","content":"Config file quick reference #     Component Default Config User Config Notes     i3 / i3-gaps /etc/regolith/i3/config, /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d ~/.config/regolith2/i3 Extend Regolith2 config by creating config.d and partials in the user config dir, or globally override it by creating config.

This dialog\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to help the user find and remember keybindings for various actions in the desktop environment. It may be dismissed with the esc key and invoked again with super shift ?  . To launch an application, press super space  and a similar dialog will load with the applications installed on the system. If you begin typing the name of the application you wish to launch, the list will filter down to only those that match. You can also scroll through the list with the arrow keys.\nNavigate to a Window #  To focus on a running application, the super ctrl space  keybinding can be used to show a dialog of all running windows. Simply select the desired window and the system will move to the window\u0026rsquo;s containing workspace and set its focus.\nCreate a new Workspace #  Workspaces (also known as \u0026ldquo;virtual desktops\u0026rdquo; in some desktop environments) are a primary way by which windows can be managed. Each workspace provides a screen for an independent set of windows. To create or navigate to an existing workspace, specify it\u0026rsquo;s index with keys super 0-9  .\nFind and Launch a File #  Searching your local computer for a specific file can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regolith provides a file search dialog via super alt space  to quickly seek and optionally load a file with its default application. Pressing enter on a selection will cause the file to be invoked with the xdg-open command.\nTerminal #  The terminal is a special application that has its own keybinding, super enter  .\nBrowser #  The preferred browser is also special and can be launched with super shift enter  .\nQuit an Application #   super shift q  will quit the focused application. For misbehaving apps, super alt q  will force quit (kill) the focused application, but note that any unsaved data may be lost.\nSwitch Workspaces #  A primary way of managing how applications occupy the screen is by the usage of workspaces. A workspace is in essence a group of zero or more applications that all present windows on the same virtual display. Users can switch workspaces to gain more space for applications to occupy. Windows can be moved across workspaces. Workspaces can be tied to physical display or be moved to other displays as needed. To switch workspaces, hold down the super  key and press one of the number keys. This will navigate to that workspace. If any windows exist in a given workspace, it will show in the bar as being active. Thus, by referring to the bar the user can know in which workspaces active applications live.\nWorkspaces can also be paged forward and backward via super tab  and super shift tab  .\nConfiguring the System #  The Settings app (also known as regolith-control-center) is the primary interface for common configuration tasks, such as configuring WiFi and Bluetooth, configuring app associations, and setting up users. The app can be launched via the super c  keybinding or from the launcher via the Regolith Settings app.\nView Keybindings #  All keybindings used by the Regolith desktop can be viewed, sorted, and executed by ilia. This dialog is launched with super shift ?  .\nManage Notifications #  Regolith\u0026rsquo;s desktop notification system is designed to prevent pop-ups that may distract the user from their work. Notifications can be viewed and managed via super n  . Specific keybindings such as deleting one or groups of notifications may be found on the help tab of the dialog. For users wishing for more visibility of current notifications, the status indicator i3xrocks-rofication may be installed via the system package manager. This will show the number of critical and normal unread notifications on the bar.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/using-regolith/configuration/","title":"Configuration","section":"Using Regolith","content":"Recommended Packages for New Users #  Looks #  Install all of the official Regolith looks:\nsudo apt install regolith-look-* NOTE: this pulls in many fonts and some graphics resources so for users looking to minimize disk usage, uninstalling looks that are unused is recommended.\nStatus Indicators #  The following snippet installs status indicator packages recommended for new users:\nsudo apt install i3xrocks-focused-window-name i3xrocks-rofication i3xrocks-info i3xrocks-app-launcher i3xrocks-memory To remove any of these indicators later, simply uninstall them from your system.

For example, to show a status indicator for your laptop battery, simply run sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery and then refresh the session using regolith-look refresh. To find what indicators are available, run apt search ^i3xrocks- or search for i3xrocks- in your favorite package manager GUI, such as Synaptic. There is more documentation available for configuring status indicators, also called \u0026ldquo;blocklets\u0026rdquo;.\nLooks #  Colors, wallpaper, window and bar layouts and other visual factors are bundled together in Regolith and called \u0026ldquo;looks\u0026rdquo;. Looks provide a simple way of changing the entire look of the desktop. Like status bar indicators, looks are packaged and are installed and removed like any other software package. By convention, Look packages use the following naming format regolith-look-\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;. apt or a GUI package manager can be used to search for available looks. To select an installed look the keybinding super alt l  presents a dialog:\nAlternatively, the terminal command regolith-look can be used to change looks and refresh the active session with the selected look.

This means that any of the listed packages can be removed. Users can make tweaks to configuration in a more stable manner by replacing a default configuration partial with their own version. This can be achieved by copying the partial to be customized into ~/.config/regolith2/i3/config.d/ and removing the original file in /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d via apt. In this way, the unmodified config partials can continue to get updates and bug fixes without impacting user-specific configuration.\nSee the i3 configuration customization how-to for examples.\nAll i3 Configuration Packages #  The following contains a list of all i3 configuration packages available in Regolith 2.1:\n   Package Function File     regolith-i3-base-launchers Launch terminal and browser /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/15_base_launchers   regolith-i3-compositor Compositor integration (delegates to regolith-compositor-\u0026lt;variant\u0026gt;) /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/80_compositor   regolith-i3-default-style Window behavior /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/40_default-style   regolith-i3-ftue First time user experience /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/84_ftue   regolith-i3-gaps-partial i3-gaps configuration (if installed, i3-gaps will replace i3) /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/35_i3-gaps   regolith-i3-gnome Regolith Settings keybindings /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/60_config_keybindings   regolith-i3-i3xrocks i3 bar status indicators configuration /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/70_bar   regolith-i3-ilia ilia integration /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/20_ilia   regolith-i3-navigation Navigation keybindings /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/30_navigation   regolith-i3-networkmanager Network and wifi functions /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/88_network-manager   regolith-i3-next-workspace Workspace utility /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/40_next-workspace   regolith-i3-remontoire Legacy keybindings view integration /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/45_remontoire   regolith-i3-resize Resize keybindings /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/50_resize-mode   regolith-i3-rofi Legacy desktop launcher integration /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/20_rofi   regolith-i3-rofication Legacy notification viewer integration /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/82_rofication   regolith-i3-rofication-ilia Notification viewer integration /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/82_rofication-ilia   regolith-i3-session Session keybindings /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/55_session_keybindings   regolith-i3-snapshot i3 workspace persistence /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/75_i3-snapshot   regolith-i3-swap-focus Toggle back to last focused window /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/40_i3-swap-focus   regolith-i3-unclutter Hides mouse when not in use /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/86_unclutter   regolith-i3-user-programs Optionally launch user programs specified in Xresources /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/90_user-programs   regolith-i3-workspace-config Workspace keybindings /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/40_workspace-config    Keybindings #  The most common keybinding change is the super  key.

Regolith 1.6\u0026rsquo;s primary feature is a return of the ISO installation method.\nFeatures #     Feature Screenshot Description     Return of Regolith Linux ISO   Up to Regolith 1.4.1, we hand-built each ISO for major version releases. This became too brittle and time intensive, and so work began on build automation to generate the ISO. This took quite awhile to complete but is now available for the 1.6 release.   New Look: Midnight   Fabian (naib864) has provided a distinctive new look with new font, icons, and GTK theme.   New Look: Solarized Light   Ricardo Pérez (ricpelo) has provided a solarized light theme.   New Status Indicator: app-launcher  Regolith user Laurent provided the idea to add a status indicator to launch Rofi, and so i3xrocks-app-launcher was added for those that prefer to use the mouse to launch apps.   Upgrades to i3-gaps and Rofi  i3-gaps is updated to 4.19.1 and Rofi to 1.6.1.

To summarize, Regolith 1.5 ships simpler workspace management, a Rofi-based Look switcher, and numerous internal optimizations and cleanup. Read below for more details.\nFeatures #     Feature Screenshot Description     Next Free Workspace  A typical part of managing workspaces in an i3-based desktop is moving to unused workspaces and then loading some applications. Before this feature, a user has to determine which unused workspace they prefer. This is done by scanning the list of existing used workspaces to determine an unused one. Now, the system can do this automatically. The super `  keybinding will move to the next free workspace. super alt `  will move the focused window into the next free workspace.   View and Change Looks via Rofi   Looks can be changed now via a Rofi dialog rather than having to configure the Xresources override via the command-line. To do this, use the keybinding super alt l  and then select a look from the dialog.   GSettings Overrides  Regolith now uses GSettings overrides to configure various GNOME settings for use with Regolith. In previous versions, settings were written globally to the user session from within the Regolith startup code. This could cause issues if the user works in multiple desktop environments. Now, the Regolith GNOME settings are defined in an override file that is only in effect while using a Regolith session. This allows switching between desktop environments without settings from Regolith impacting other environments.   New Looks   Users have contributed some new Looks to Regolith: Dracula, Gruvbox, and PopOs. Each of these looks presents a distinctive color palate, typeface, and GTK theme.   i3-gaps upgraded to 4.18.2  See the i3-gaps release notes for more information   More Refined Customizations  Numerous small changes allow more granular system customization, such as specifying the temperature unit, custom Compositor settings, and a more comprehensive way of changing i3 keybindings without having to copy the entire config file.   More Desktop Environment Packages  The following packages can be installed in place of regolith-desktop for specific sets of packages based on user needs: regolith-desktop-minimal, regolith-desktop-standard, regolith-desktop-mobile, and regolith-desktop-complete   New default compositor: Picom version 8  See the Picom release notes for more information on what has changed.   Remontoire upgraded to version 1.4  Includes better multi-monitor support and other bug fixes and enhancements.   Optional integration with td-cli   Access a simple todo app via Rofi.   Documentation of development process  The Regolith development process is now better documented for greater transparency and to foster inclusion.

In addition to the package updates, a new boot animation is provided by the package plymouth-theme-regolith that is installed by default on the ISO. The ISO also now excludes a deprecated touchpad driver that was conflicting with Settings. Existing PPA-based installations can simply get the updates via their typical package update process. Regolith Linux ISO users can update to R1.4.1 by applying regular package updates.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/","title":"1.4 Release Notes","section":"Releases","content":"Regolith R1.4 is a major feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. Regolith is now smaller and more efficient. The ISO-based installer is now based from the Xubuntu image, and moves from the gdm3 display manager to LightDM. This allows for less resource consumption at runtime and dramatically smaller download size1. A new look, lascaille and file search dialog round out the major new features. Read below for more details.\nIf you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.4 has changed in that it reads more configuration from Xresources. The intention of this change is to require a full copy of the i3 config file less often, by allowing users to customize the system via Xresource overrides instead of copy/edit of the i3 config file.  For R1.4 in particular @ploum has provided many of the ideas and validation. Gratitude goes out to Regolith contributors and users @cheginit, @nalderto, @baldrailers, @ivomarino, @Josh-Letts, @LawZava, @SkyyySi, @tomster, @gdeflaux, @appelgriebsch, @farsil, and @MrKovar for their time and attention. Also thanks to all that helped to test and filed issues for bugs and feature requests!\nKnown Issues #  Issues and fixes are being tracked in this project.\nFeatures #     Feature Screenshot Description     Remontoire 1.3.1   - Can render keybindings from i3 over socket or from any file. - Can be configured to display on any screen edge. - Visual updates and bug fixes. - Presentation changeable via CSS.   New default look: Lascaille   A new look with a bolder, tighter typeface and a darker, higher contrast color theme has become Regolith\u0026rsquo;s default look in 1.4. Cahuella and other looks continue to be available and can be installed with a few commands.   New File Search Dialog   Based on Rofi and mlocate, users can now quickly find files and launch their default editors from a global dialog.   Faster, Easier Customization  Virtually everything exportable from the i3 config can now be overridden directly with Xresources declarations, from changing the meta key to specifying the command that launches the app search dialog. Additionally, up to 3 user configured programs can be set to start upon session initialization. All of this is possible without creating a user copy of the i3 config file, but rather by overriding a specific Xresources.   i3xrocks supports conf.d style configuration  The status indicators in the bar can now be installed and configured independently. This allows for a cleaner dependency model and more efficient runtime characteristics. It also provides future flexibility for user contributed modules and status indicators. Plus, users can provide their own block descriptors in the user directory to easily override the defaults without having to change the i3 config file.   New architecture support: arm64  With testing done on a Raspberry Pi 4, Regolith now is installable via PPA when using Ubuntu on arm64 devices with the necessary hardware support.   Rewrite of Rofication  Rofication has been rewritten to require less dependencies and be more stable by Regolith contributor @farsil.   New Ubuntu release support: Focal Fossa   Regolith runs as a desktop environment in Canonical\u0026rsquo;s latest release of Ubuntu: 20.04 \u0026ldquo;Focal Fossa\u0026rdquo;   Time and Space Optimizations in ISO release  By switching from GDM3 to LightDM, Regolith avoids loading some unnecessary desktop components into RAM, resulting in between 200MB to 300MB savings on cold start. Additionally, the LiveCD installer is now based on the Xubuntu LiveCD which dramatically lowers the size of the installer and install image of the system2. Finally, with more fine-grained control of the bar status blocks, only the blocks you\u0026rsquo;ve installed will run.   Pluggable Desktop Notification Components  Users can now cleanly switch between desktop notification implementations such as dunst and notify-osd, in addition to Rofication without resorting to hacks.   Integrate gnome-terminal over st-term by Default   Regolith 1.4 uses gnome-terminal with a dynamically generated profile to overcome some character encoding and input devices. st is still available, simply by installing the regolith-st package.   Picom (Compton) config can be overriden by user  Users can provide their own Picom compositor config in their user directory.   i3 reload becomes Regolith reload  Refreshing the UI (look, colors, fonts, etc.) after making changes is now as easy as super shift r  .   Polish, polish, polish  Just as in previous releases, many tiny fixes and enhancements were added to Regolith in version 1.4.    Fixes #  Have a look at the R1.4 project page for a list of bug fixes.\n  This does not mean that Regolith uses Xfce4 or any other aspect of Xubuntu other than the install image. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The trade-off is that users need to install more of the software they require after installation. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "},{"id":20,"href":"/docs/reference/Releases/regolith-1.3.1-release-notes/","title":"1.3.1 Release Notes","section":"Releases","content":"R1.3.1 is a quick followup to R1.3 that adds polish and usability features. Headlining features include a more concise way of overriding Xresource defaults and several enhancements to the Remontoire keybinding viewer.\nIf you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.3.1 has changed in that the comment format has been modified to be readable by Remontoire (example). Without updating your copy i3 config comments, you will not see any keybindings.  Features #     Feature Screenshot Description     Remontoire 1.1.1   Provides a live view of active i3 keybindings, introduces a machine-readable comment format for i3 config files, and fixes several layout and presentation bugs reported by users.   Ayu Looks   The community contributed Ayu themes have been fully integrated into Regolith with updates to package dependencies and configurations.   Rofi polishing   Numerous updates to the Rofi themes for all provided looks.   Easier Customization  Now, overriding specific Xresources values can be easily done by supplying only the overrides in ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources without needing to copying and update any existing files. Additionally, any Xresources files in ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources.d can be referenced without absolute path, enabling easier multi-machine configurations.   Utilize GNOME and update-alternatives for Default Apps  GNOME settings for default browser and update-alternatives for preferred terminal are now used by Regolith. No custom configuration changes are required.   Xresources updates  More UI configuration pulled out of component configs and into Xresources provides more flexibility in how custom looks can be.   Locale used for date/time format  For those not using the US date and time formats, the bar clock will now automatically use the GNOME hour format and the locale LC_TIME setting to automatically display date and time in the regional form without configuration.   UI tweaks and polishing   Many small updates across all UI components to further polish the interface, including a new optional dark background adapted from work by /u/InfernusZ9.    Fixes #   Debian package dependencies for various Regolith Looks have been fixed. Layout issues with Remontoire have been addressed.

Keybindings Dialog   To allow for a more consistent look and collapsible content for various monitor dimensions, a custom shortcut dialog was developed called Remontoire.   Pluggable Compositors  The subsystem providing visual effects, the compositor, can behave differently based on hardware and driver support. Regolith now packages 3 compositor backends: compton-glx (based on Picom), xcompmgr, and none.   i3-snapshot  In office environments it is common to switch between various display configurations (desk, meeting room\u0026hellip;). i3-snapshot allows the user to quickly save and restore existing window layouts in a session.   New Rofi theme   Based on work by /u/InfernusZ9, the Rofi launcher is less distracting.   New notification UI based on Rofication  The previous notification UI was a hold over from more traditional desktop environments that prefer to present an on-screen dialog when a notification is received. Because user-focus is paramount, this was changed such that an indicator in the bar displays the number of unread notifications and the user decides when to view them via a keybinding or button click.   Floating Control Panel  The gnome-control-center app can have a hard time adapting to constrained tiled layouts common with i3-wm. Now when the control panel is loaded, it floats above the existing windows to allow for a quick settings change without impacting other apps.   Clickable Bar Status Actions  For convienence, the default blocks on the bar will launch configuration apps for the associated block. For example, the battery block will launch the power settings control panel, and the notification block will launch the notification viewer.   Discrete and packagable Looks  The underlying style framework used by Regolith has been revamped to allow for \u0026ldquo;looks\u0026rdquo;: colors, themes, typeface, and other thematic state. Looks can be switched with a single command.   New bar status components  Network, keybindings, notifications, focused window, and other blocklets have been improved and added.   Build System  Build scripts were added and improved to allow for the generation of Regolith packages in an automated fashion, making it easier for others to roll their own.   Website  An entirely new website is launching with R1.3, to integrate more content and make it faster for users to find information.    Fixes #   i3-gaps-wm: Fix for workspace label bug on startup. Revamping some keybindings based on user feedback. i3xrocks: numerous tweaks and fixes for status indicators. regolith-gnome-flashback: numerous fixes and policy enhancements to session management.

The new major version 2 provides for a simplification of Regolith as a whole, with some new features as well. This upgrade will not be backwards compatible with 1.x series (but as always, users may choose to specify their own i3 config). However Regolith 2 is not radically different than the previous version. This major version bump is to allow for users to upgrade on their own schedules. As such, the 1.x package repository (PPA) will not be used for Regolith 2 packages.\nRelease Status #  We\u0026rsquo;re currently in pre-alpha phase of the development process. The environment is generally stable for day to day work, however because we\u0026rsquo;re reserving the right to make big changes still, using it in a production context is not recommended at this time.\nShipped Changes #   Convert i3 config to partials conf.d style Xresource discovery Migration from rofi to ilia as the desktop executor Migration to nerdfonts for looks to simplify and enhance font icons A new build system decoupled from launchpad.net facilitating easier and more consistent distro development Port of looks lascaille and nord from the 1.x looks  Changes in Development #   New website (this one!) Polish for ilia Bugs in wallpaper handling (gnome/dotfiles) Better HiDPI support out of the box Better first time user experience Porting most existing looks to new Xresource schema Rebranding from \u0026ldquo;Regolith Linux\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Regolith Desktop Environment\u0026rdquo;  Expected Release Date #  Due to the volunteer nature of the Regolith project, it\u0026rsquo;s simply not possible to a promise ship date. However, we would like to have something usable by the time of the next LTS version of Ubuntu is released, in April 2022.\nExpected Upgrade Experience #  The Regolith 2 desktop environment will require the removal of the existing Regolith 1.x PPA and the addition of a new Debian repository. regolith-desktop will continue to be the top-level package that provides the complete desktop environment. As before, i3 config files can be entirely controlled by users by staging a copy in their XDG user configuration directory, however with i3 4.20+, a new option of simply providing any additional configuration via config partials is also supported.\nLearn More #  See here for details on how to install the current pre-release version of Regolith 2, and here for information on how you can provide feedback or contribute.\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/posts/attribution/","title":"Thanks to","section":"Blog","content":"The Regolith Desktop exists as an integration of many open source projects and a little bit of glue code and some unique desktop components.

The name of the file maps to the position of the status indicator on the bar, e.g. a file\u0026rsquo;s name starting with 10_ mean its corresponding indicator will be positioned before an indicator which has a configuration file starting with 20_. Within each file there is some information that i3xrocks uses to execute a script that ultimately returns the data you see on the bar. Some of the status indicators have configuration parameters that can be adjusted to your liking. For example, if you would prefer that the battery status changes more frequently, the polling interval can be updated. The first thing to do in order to customize the bar is to copy the indicators you wish to see from /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/ to ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d. Each file in ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d can be modified as you see fit. To change the order of status indicators on the bar, simply change the name of the files to the sort order you prefer.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve made your changes, refreshing the session should cause the bar to update based on your new configuration.\nFor example, to change the order of the battery and net traffic blocks on the bar and not display notifications, perform the following steps:\n$ ls /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/ 01_setup 30_net-traffic 80_battery 80_rofication 90_time $ mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d $ cd /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/ $ cp 01_setup ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d/01_setup $ cp 80_battery ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d/30_battery $ cp 30_net-traffic ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d/80_net-traffic $ regolith-look refresh Note: If any block configuration exists in the user directory ~/.config/regolith2/i3xrocks/conf.d, then the defaults in /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/ will be ignored.\nFurther Reading #  The reference page for configurations has more details about the configuration files used with Regolith Linux.\n"},{"id":27,"href":"/docs/howtos/replace-notification-system/","title":"Change Notification Systems","section":"How To","content":"NOTICE: This page was copied from the Regolith 1.x website and has not been updated for Regolith 2.

In Regolith, the compositor is defined as a pluggable “extension point” in the packaging system. This means that compositors can be switched out simply by installing the packages that contain them. The underlying packaging system will ensure there are no conflicts and that all the dependencies of a given compositor are also installed.\nWARNING: In Regolith 2.x, the default compositor is \u0026ldquo;no compositor\u0026rdquo;.

Run the following command to install Regolith Desktop and all of it\u0026rsquo;s dependencies:\nsudo apt install regolith-system-ubuntu 4. Reboot #  Once the system boots back up, the lightdm login manager will allow you to log into your new Regolith environment.\n"},{"id":42,"href":"/docs/howtos/override-xres/","title":"Override Xresources","section":"How To","content":"Regolith relies on the Xresources system to provide a consolidated interface configuration. By changing Xresources values, Regolith can be customized in ways such as updating the user interface, specifying custom behaviors, or defining a specific format for some of the blocklets on the bar.\nIn Regolith, Xresources values can be changed via two methods: supplying your own Xresources files, and overriding the existing Xresources values. The latter approach is strongly recommended, as it makes upgrading to newer versions of Regolith less likely to break your customizations. If you copy the Xresources tree completely you\u0026rsquo;ll need to integrate any breaking changes in future versions manually.  Initialization #  When a Regolith session is started, Xresources are loaded in the following order:\n   File Optional Notes     ~/.Xresources Y Intended for non-Regolith settings   /usr/share/regolith-look/**/ N The Regolith Xresources associated with looks   ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources Y Applies specific overrides to Xresources defaults    It is recommended to use ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources for customization as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require the specification of redundant settings and is easier to maintain over time.\nDetermining which values can be changed #  The xrdb tool can be used to list the existing Xresources values. There is a number of existing overrides in the R2.1 release:\n$ xrdb -query [...] gnome.terminal.scrollbar:\tnever gnome.terminal.use-transparent-background:\ttrue gtk.document_font_name:\tSans 12 gtk.font_name:\tBitstream Vera Sans 12 gtk.icon_theme_name:\tPapirus-Dark gtk.monospace_font_name:\tBitstreamVeraSansMono Nerd Font 13 gtk.theme_name:\tAyu-Mirage-Dark i3-wm.bar.background.color:\t#1F2430 [...] Examples #  Note that the commands presented below append text to a file, so running the command more than once will result in duplicate entires.\nExample - Update the UI for High DPI Screens #  By using the ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources override file, we will only need to specify the values we wish to change. The xrdb tool can be used to determine what current values are set to.\n Create or add the following value to your ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources file:  Xft.dpi: 192 Reload the Xresources configuration:  $ regolith-look refresh Open a new terminal to see the change take effect.  192 is just an example value, please adjust as needed.\nExample - Change i3 bar position #  $ xrdb -query | grep position i3-wm.bar.position:\tbottom $ echo \u0026quot;i3-wm.bar.position:\ttop\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Change GTK Theme #  $ xrdb -query | grep gtk gtk.theme_name:\tAyu-Mirage-Dark $ echo \u0026quot;gnome.gtk.theme:\tAdwaita\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Disable the System Tray #  $ echo \u0026quot;i3-wm.bar.trayoutput:\tnone\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Use Alt instead of Win as Super #  $ echo \u0026quot;i3-wm.mod: Mod1\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources $ echo \u0026quot;i3-wm.alt: Mod4\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources Then Reload i3 for the change to take effect.

However when installing Regolith into an existing Ubuntu system, some desktop components that Regolith does not require will still be installed on the system.

Overriding Xresources value is described in a separate article.  Regolith uses a number of configuration files to determine the behavior and look of various components. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to simply edit these files directly, users who do so run the risk of having their configurations overwritten upon future updates. The Debian packaging system should ask users if they wish to take updates or keep the existing files, but this may have unintended side effects if users take partial updates of files. As such Regolith, upon login, will look for user-staged version of configuration files and load those instead of the defaults if they exist. This is recommended over editing the files directly as it gives the user more control over their configuration. This page describes how to create these files.\nDepending on what you wish to change, you may need your own copy if the i3 config file. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to change the way Regolith looks, Xresources may be all you need. If you want to update or add keybindings or swap out components, you\u0026rsquo;ll most likely need to stage the i3 config file.\ni3 Config #   Copy the default Regolith i3 config file into your home directory:  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith2/i3 $ cp /etc/regolith/i3/config ~/.config/regolith2/i3/config Log out and back in. The Regolith session will automatically detect and load your user-staged file.  Verify the Change #   Verify by running i3 --moreversion and noting the config file that is printed as a result. It should be the copy you just created. If not, be sure the path is correct. It must exactly be ~/.config/regolith2/i3/config for Regolith to load it.
