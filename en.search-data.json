The name of the file maps to the position of the status indicator on the bar, e.g. a file’s name starting with 10_ mean its corresponding indicator will be positioned before an indicator which has a configuration file starting with 20_. Within each file there is some information that i3xrocks uses to execute a script that ultimately returns the data you see on the bar. Some of the status indicators have configuration parameters that can be adjusted to your liking. For example, if you would prefer that the battery status changes more frequently, the polling interval can be updated. The first thing to do in order to customize the bar is to copy the indicators you wish to see from /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/ to ~/.config/regolith3/i3xrocks/conf.d. Each file in ~/.config/regolith3/i3xrocks/conf.d can be modified as you see fit. To change the order of status indicators on the bar, simply change the name of the files to the sort order you prefer.\nOnce you’ve made your changes, refreshing the session should cause the bar to update based on your new configuration.\nFor example, to change the order of the battery and net traffic blocks on the bar and not display notifications, perform the following steps:\n$ ls /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/ 01_setup 30_net-traffic 80_battery 80_rofication 90_time $ mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith3/i3xrocks/conf.d $ cp /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/01_setup ~/.config/regolith3/i3xrocks/conf.d/01_setup $ cp /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/80_battery ~/.config/regolith3/i3xrocks/conf.d/30_battery $ cp /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/30_net-traffic ~/.config/regolith3/i3xrocks/conf.d/80_net-traffic $ regolith-look refresh In the above steps the following actions are performed:\nThe current i3xrocks modules are listed that exist in the directory created by regolith The directory where user configuration lives is created at ~/.config/regolith3/i3xrocks/conf.d Three files are copied from the application created directory to the user created directory. This will cause the order to change if the user change the n_ number like described in the first paragraph of this article The regolith-look refresh command is run to refresh the Bar Status Indicators Note: If any block configuration exists in the user directory ~/.config/regolith3/i3xrocks/conf.d, then the defaults in /usr/share/i3xrocks/conf.d/ will be ignored.","further-reading#Further Reading":"The reference page for configurations has more details about the configuration files used with Regolith Linux."},"title":"Change Bar Status indicators"},"/docs/howtos/change-background/":{"data":{"":"","wallpaper#Wallpaper":"Most Regolith Looks provide a default desktop color or image.

After a package has been identified to require building, the build system delegates to the package-specific build system to generate the target packages, such as debian source and binary packages.

A product, project, and brand. Codename - A well defined and announced snapshot of a set of packages that are consumed as a whole. May be considered a software release with a specific name such as 36 or Jammy. Architecture - In the context of this document, denotes a CPU and base system hardware. Regolith currently targets the amd64 and arm64 architectures. Stage - Represents a snapshot of a set of packages at a modeled level of maturity. In Regolith the following stages from least-stable to most-stable are modeled: experimental - For packages and package changes that may be reverted, removed, or change significantly over time. Serious bugs are common and expected here. unstable - For packages changes that are planned to reach a release but have yet to undergo much testing. Serious bugs may occur from time to time. Regolith core developers may run their testing and development from this stage but users are discouraged from consuming packages from unstable. testing - For packages undergoing testing by Regolith developers and early adopters. Bugs occur but serious bugs should not often pop up in this stage. Regolith users that wish to get access to fixes and new features earlier may consume from this stage with the understanding that bugs are to be expected (, and reporting them is appreciated!) release - For packages that have been determined to be suitable for general use. While minor bugs may be present in packages at this stage, the bugs present should not interfere with general use of the environments for users on supported distros and releases. Suite - Represents the published packages repository. It has a one-to-one corresponding relationship to Stage. In other words Stage has the point of view of software development and Suite has the point of view of published archive repositories. experimental suite - corresponds to experimental stage unstable suite - corresponds to unstable stage testing suite - corresponds to testing stage stable suite - corresponds to release-X_Y and release-current stages Component - Each published repository is divided into several components. They correspond to Regolith released versions. In Regolith these are main and correposnding versions (for example v3.2, v3.1, etc) Target ~ Represents a specific sequence of distro, codename, stage, and architecture for which a set of packages exist. Manifest ~ A file that specifies a set of the properties name, origin, and snapshot for a list of packages. A manifest is a file that represents a snapshot of a target in time. Package Manager ~ A set of formats and programs that allow for packages to be installed in a distro. The package manager may very by distro.

Pluggable Compositors The subsystem providing visual effects, the compositor, can behave differently based on hardware and driver support. Regolith now packages 3 compositor backends: compton-glx (based on Picom), xcompmgr, and none. i3-snapshot In office environments it is common to switch between various display configurations (desk, meeting room…). i3-snapshot allows the user to quickly save and restore existing window layouts in a session. New Rofi theme Based on work by /u/InfernusZ9, the Rofi launcher is less distracting. New notification UI based on Rofication The previous notification UI was a hold over from more traditional desktop environments that prefer to present an on-screen dialog when a notification is received. Because user-focus is paramount, this was changed such that an indicator in the bar displays the number of unread notifications and the user decides when to view them via a keybinding or button click. Floating Control Panel The gnome-control-center app can have a hard time adapting to constrained tiled layouts common with i3-wm. Now when the control panel is loaded, it floats above the existing windows to allow for a quick settings change without impacting other apps.

Locale used for date/time format For those not using the US date and time formats, the bar clock will now automatically use the GNOME hour format and the locale LC_TIME setting to automatically display date and time in the regional form without configuration. UI tweaks and polishing Many small updates across all UI components to further polish the interface, including a new optional dark background adapted from work by /u/InfernusZ9. ","fixes#Fixes":" Debian package dependencies for various Regolith Looks have been fixed. Layout issues with Remontoire have been addressed. Compton configuration cleaned up "},"title":"1.3.1 Release Notes"},"/docs/reference/releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/":{"data":{"":"Regolith R1.4 is a major feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. Regolith is now smaller and more efficient. The ISO-based installer is now based from the Xubuntu image, and moves from the gdm3 display manager to LightDM. This allows for less resource consumption at runtime and dramatically smaller download size[^1]. A new look, lascaille and file search dialog round out the major new features. Read below for more details.\nIf you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.4 has changed in that it reads more configuration from Xresources. The intention of this change is to require a full copy of the i3 config file less often, by allowing users to customize the system via Xresource overrides instead of copy/edit of the i3 config file. For R1.4 in particular @ploum has provided many of the ideas and validation. Gratitude goes out to Regolith contributors and users @cheginit, @nalderto, @baldrailers, @ivomarino, @Josh-Letts, @LawZava, @SkyyySi, @tomster, @gdeflaux, @appelgriebsch, @farsil, and @MrKovar for their time and attention. Also thanks to all that helped to test and filed issues for bugs and feature requests!","features#Features":" Feature Screenshot Description Remontoire 1.3.1 - Can render keybindings from i3 over socket or from any file. - Can be configured to display on any screen edge. - Visual updates and bug fixes. - Presentation changeable via CSS. New default look: Lascaille A new look with a bolder, tighter typeface and a darker, higher contrast color theme has become Regolith’s default look in 1.4. Cahuella and other looks continue to be available and can be installed with a few commands. New File Search Dialog Based on Rofi and mlocate, users can now quickly find files and launch their default editors from a global dialog. Faster, Easier Customization Virtually everything exportable from the i3 config can now be overridden directly with Xresources declarations, from changing the meta key to specifying the command that launches the app search dialog. Additionally, up to 3 user configured programs can be set to start upon session initialization. All of this is possible without creating a user copy of the i3 config file, but rather by overriding a specific Xresources. i3xrocks supports conf.d style configuration The status indicators in the bar can now be installed and configured independently. This allows for a cleaner dependency model and more efficient runtime characteristics. It also provides future flexibility for user contributed modules and status indicators. Plus, users can provide their own block descriptors in the user directory to easily override the defaults without having to change the i3 config file. New architecture support: arm64 With testing done on a Raspberry Pi 4, Regolith now is installable via PPA when using Ubuntu on arm64 devices with the necessary hardware support. Rewrite of Rofication Rofication has been rewritten to require less dependencies and be more stable by Regolith contributor @farsil. New Ubuntu release support: Focal Fossa Regolith runs as a desktop environment in Canonical’s latest release of Ubuntu: 20.04 “Focal Fossa” Time and Space Optimizations in ISO release By switching from GDM3 to LightDM, Regolith avoids loading some unnecessary desktop components into RAM, resulting in between 200MB to 300MB savings on cold start. Additionally, the LiveCD installer is now based on the Xubuntu LiveCD which dramatically lowers the size of the installer and install image of the system[^2]. Finally, with more fine-grained control of the bar status blocks, only the blocks you’ve installed will run. Pluggable Desktop Notification Components Users can now cleanly switch between desktop notification implementations such as dunst and notify-osd, in addition to Rofication without resorting to hacks. Integrate gnome-terminal over st-term by Default Regolith 1.4 uses gnome-terminal with a dynamically generated profile to overcome some character encoding and input devices. st is still available, simply by installing the regolith-st package. Picom (Compton) config can be overriden by user Users can provide their own Picom compositor config in their user directory. i3 reload becomes Regolith reload Refreshing the UI (look, colors, fonts, etc.) after making changes is now as easy as super shift r. Polish, polish, polish Just as in previous releases, many tiny fixes and enhancements were added to Regolith in version 1.4.

","features#Features":" Feature Screenshot Description Next Free Workspace A typical part of managing workspaces in an i3-based desktop is moving to unused workspaces and then loading some applications. Before this feature, a user has to determine which unused workspace they prefer. This is done by scanning the list of existing used workspaces to determine an unused one. Now, the system can do this automatically. The super ` keybinding will move to the next free workspace. super alt ` will move the focused window into the next free workspace. View and Change Looks via Rofi Looks can be changed now via a Rofi dialog rather than having to configure the Xresources override via the command-line. To do this, use the keybinding super alt l and then select a look from the dialog. GSettings Overrides Regolith now uses GSettings overrides to configure various GNOME settings for use with Regolith. In previous versions, settings were written globally to the user session from within the Regolith startup code. This could cause issues if the user works in multiple desktop environments. Now, the Regolith GNOME settings are defined in an override file that is only in effect while using a Regolith session. This allows switching between desktop environments without settings from Regolith impacting other environments. New Looks Users have contributed some new Looks to Regolith: Dracula, Gruvbox, and PopOs. Each of these looks presents a distinctive color palate, typeface, and GTK theme. i3-gaps upgraded to 4.18.2 See the i3-gaps release notes for more information More Refined Customizations Numerous small changes allow more granular system customization, such as specifying the temperature unit, custom Compositor settings, and a more comprehensive way of changing i3 keybindings without having to copy the entire config file. More Desktop Environment Packages The following packages can be installed in place of regolith-desktop for specific sets of packages based on user needs: regolith-desktop-minimal, regolith-desktop-standard, regolith-desktop-mobile, and regolith-desktop-complete New default compositor: Picom version 8 See the Picom release notes for more information on what has changed. Remontoire upgraded to version 1.4 Includes better multi-monitor support and other bug fixes and enhancements. Optional integration with td-cli Access a simple todo app via Rofi.

This became too brittle and time intensive, and so work began on build automation to generate the ISO. This took quite awhile to complete but is now available for the 1.6 release. New Look: Midnight Fabian (naib864) has provided a distinctive new look with new font, icons, and GTK theme. New Look: Solarized Light Ricardo Pérez (ricpelo) has provided a solarized light theme. New Status Indicator: app-launcher Regolith user Laurent provided the idea to add a status indicator to launch Rofi, and so i3xrocks-app-launcher was added for those that prefer to use the mouse to launch apps. Upgrades to i3-gaps and Rofi i3-gaps is updated to 4.19.1 and Rofi to 1.6.1.

To generalize across X11 and Wayland sessions, Xresource keys have been renamed to remove “i3-”. This means that users with XResource overrides on earlier versions of Regolith will need to update the key names. Specifically, keys starting with i3-wm now start with wm. For example, in Regolith 2.x to change gaps size, i3-wm.gaps.inner.size is being renamed to wm.gaps.inner.size in Regolith 3.0. Some functionality may now require you to install certain packages manually. An example here is the regolith-wm-user-programs package that runs programs defined in your Regolith configuration declared by wm.program.\u003cN\u003e:.

This means that any of the listed packages can be removed. Users can make tweaks to configuration in a more stable manner by replacing a default configuration partial with their own version. This can be achieved by copying the partial to be customized into ~/.config/regolith3/i3/config.d/ and removing the original file in /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d via apt.

For example wm.foo.bar changes to i3-wm.foo.bar for Regolith 1.x and 2.x. The most common keybinding change is the super key. Regolith uses Xresources as the canonical source of truth for settings, which are read by various UI components. The table of Xresources keys open to user configuration is available elsewhere.

In order to generate the ISO with the production apt URL the packages needed to be published first. This essentially required a way of publishing the release before we wish users to get access to the packages. In order to achieve this the idea of using a URL and switching the host seemed like a good idea. Problems occurred when the realities of TLS cert management became apparent. When the domain was remapped to the new host, the TLS certificates were not. Later, when the problem became known, the hosting provider gave advice on how to resolve the problem. However, the original source domain name (regolith-desktop.io) somehow is not able to take a new cert registration from the new host. Some remedies have been suggested by users, but due to the nature of the production host we opted to leave the system as-is and migrate to the new domain to prevent further churn for users.\nWhen the 2.1 release was published, the URL was updated to regolith-desktop.org.

It’s been a longer release cycle than hoped, as many users are wanting to run Regolith on the latest Ubuntu LTS: Noble. In this release, the items that come to mind that required more time than expected were the systemd init refactoring and integration of GNOME 46. Soumya initiated the effort to clean up and make our init code generally consistent with systemd, cleaning up some rather old ad-hoc shell script init code. This refactoring covers both Sway and i3 window managers. I expect this effort to provide a more robust and consistent start up process that in turn will allow users to more easily configure and reason about the execution of their desktop setup.\nWe will require at least one more beta to clean up some issues encountered between X11 and Wayland sessions, as well as take in some great fixes provided by community members. But, it feels like we are almost there.\nDebConf 24 Due to the generous support of our financial contributors, Soumya and I were able to meet up at DebConf 24 this year in Busan, Korea. This is our second in-person conference meet up; last year Canonical graciously sponsored both of us to attend the Ubuntu Summit in Riga, Latvia. That event was incredibly productive and so we were both keen on further opportunities to collaborate in person and with the larger Debian world.\nThe travel costs associated with our attendance at the conference was paid from our Open Collective account. While we do not spend a lot of effort to advertise or solicit financial contributions, happily there are enough people donating to the project to allow us to travel from time to time when advantageous to the project and it fits into our personal schedules. There are also a few financial contributors over the years that have contributed rather generous sums to the project. While I don’t feel it appropriate to call them out by name here, we are very happy to have received these funds to support the project.\nWe aim to invest all of the financial contributions back into the project such that users will receive value back in terms of better quality software, broader support, and healthy working relationships with related projects.\nWhat’s Coming Next Debian Project Integration Soumya has begun the effort to integrate the Wayland session into the Debian package repository. Our goal is to integrate the entire wayland session into Debian. Once there, we plan to then provide a “spin” or “flavor” to downstream Ubuntu. I hope that this will eventually result in an officially supported flavor that will enable users to install Regolith from an ISO as has been done in past LTS releases. However due to time constraints, I will not take on providing an ISO for the 24.04 release.\nSimplified Debian Repositories Khosrow has been working for a number of months on an updated Debian apt repo setup. Once this is in place, the Regolith deb repos will be far more consistent with other projects and will be easier for users to configure and reason about.\nArmesto Work on a rust-based replacement to the rofication daemon is expected to land in the next release, in addition to the Wayland session getting a more consistent waybar configuration. This will also set the stage to enable some user-requested capabilities of notifications, such as a stronger visual indication of new notifications.\nIlia More work is planned to go into ilia to modularize pages such that it is usable by any general desktop environment. The Regolith-specific logic will move to plugins provided by distinct binary packages. This will allow easier integration into Debian and provide another launcher option to the free desktop community.\nAdditionally I will continue to work on load performance improvements for users that experience lag in the dialog loading of applications."},"title":"Status Updates August 2024"},"/posts/status_update_10_24/":{"data":{"":"","regolith-33#Regolith 3.3":"Work continues on the next Regolith release.

I was able to attend in person and while present at the conference, had a wonderful time touring around a few of the many many parks by bike. The talk itself was intended to be a simple project status update. However during the conference a number of inspiring talks motivated me to try for more. In particular, it struck me during a demo of the new Cosmic Desktop, that rarely if ever did I hear anyone discussing why i3-like windowing environments are attractive to some users. So, I attempted to briefly explain my take during my brief talk:\ni3-like environments (as typically configured, of course you can do whatever you like) bias towards application usage over discovery. Concretely, i3 expects a bit more of the user, to know what they want to do. In return, the system throws less distraction and minutia at the user. This, at lease in my experience, leads to longer periods of deep concentration on the problem I’m working on. In summary, the user is better able to put their attention where it matters: the application.\nDue to the short period of the talk, I didn’t have much time to get my point across, but hopefully the information was interesting to some attendees.

It looks like we’re getting some help from upstream, but it may be some time until we’re able to support GNOME 45-based distros if the solution ends up being that we need to implement our own portal backend to coexist with GNOME’s backend.\nAdditionally, Ubuntu 24.04 will be an LTS release and the people behind Ubuntu are putting extra work into it to ensure it’s a great one.

It was a great help and it was an effective tool for collaboration. Over time though, I and others in the project had a desire to move to an open platform. In part this is simply due to the risky nature of relying on “free” versions of commercial, proprietary platforms. Partly due to the Ubuntu’s adoption of the Matrix protocol for some community collaboration, I found it to be functional and easy to use. A Matrix “Space” for the Regolith project has been setup, any everyone is welcome to join.

It offers a keyboard based workflow and a tiling window manager that allows efficient management of windows, monitors and workspaces. Built on top of Ubuntu, GNOME Flashback, and i3, Regolith stands on a well-supported and consistent foundation.\nIn its current implementation, the use i3 window manager binds Regolith to X11. While X11 is fairly mature, it was never built for modern systems and is based on assumptions that are valid only for computers of the ’90s. Some of the issues present in X11 based window managers are low framerates, poor support for HiDPi panels, higher latency, screen tearing etc. Wayland is a display protocol that is written from scratch and aims at simplicity and extensibility Wayland has been in development for quite some time now and its implementations are now stable enough to be considered for daily usage. In fact, many desktop environments like gnome are now providing their wayland implementations as default. Sway window manager was introduced as a drop-in replacement for i3. It is based on wayland and is devoid of most of the issues present in X11 based window managers and compositors.\nNote: The work described in this post was done as part of my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2022 project under the organisation CCExtractor.\nObjective The project intends to achieve integration of swaywm with the regolith ecosystem. This means, compatibility with GNOME services, integration of a configuration management system, theming using regolith look and support for other extras provided by regolith in a wayland-based environment.\nIntegrating sway with regolith In this section, I will described everything that I did to achieve sway integration with regolith. This required modifying several existing packages as well as writing code for new scripts and binaries.\nPorting the regolith app launcher (ilia) to wayland After having a discussion with Ken, we decided that the most important part of a tiling window manager setup from a user’s perspective is the app-launcher. Regolith on X11 ships with its own app launcher called ilia. It also provides several features apart from launching apps. This includes showing keybindings, launching terminal commands, list applications and workspaces and search files just to name a few.\nIlia is written in vala and GTK. This means, ilia had support for wayland right out of the box. Despite this inherent compatibility, ilia seemed to crash everytime. After looking into the logs, I realised that the issue was not with ilia but with the way wayland roots (wlr) handles windows that need to be ignored by the compositor. Turns out, wlr provides an extension to the wayland protocols called wlr-layer-shell in order to handle panels and other applications that need to be positioned automatically. A client implementation of this protocol for GTK based applications is provided by the library gtk-layer-shell. To maintain support for both X11 and wayland, I check the XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable and use gtk-layer-shell library only if the session type is wayland.\nCurrently, the wayland compatible version of ilia is not packaged and exists in a seperate branch.\nTrawl - A backend agnostic configuration manager Wayland lacks support for Xresources natively and requires the use XWayland. This might not be desirable as it forces users to enable Xwayland forcing them to be a part of a legacy ecosystem. This is the reason why we decided to create a display backend agnostic configuration manager that can be used by various applications. To maintain compatibility with the existing regolith ecosystem it was crutial to replicate the format and functionaility XResources as much as possible. Trawl is a file based configuration management system written in rust that tries to fulfill these requirements.\nTrawl is comprised of two parts - Configuration Daemon (trawld) and Trawl Client (trawldb). For IPC, it uses the DBus specification, which allows other applications to access trawl resources with ease. In fact, trawl comes with libraries for C and rust that make interaction with trawl clients hassle free. Trawl also tries to replicate most of the features provided by Xresources by replicating the functionality available using the xrdb CLI.\nSway - adding the set_from_resource command Sway aims to be a drop in alternative for i3. But there are some features which make sense only within the X11 ecosystem, and one such feature is the set_from_resource command in the configs. This command allows users to set variables within the i3 configurations by querying XResources for specific keys. Due to the lack of XResources alternatives that are display backend agnostic, the creators of sway decided not to implement it, even if its at the cost of breaking compatibility with i3 configurations.\nRegolith relies heavily on XResources based configurations. This helps acheive functional configurations to some extent, such that you can replicate your window manager setup just by copying over your XResources and config partials. In order to maintain a consistent experience across the board, it was absolutely crutial to re-implement set_from_resource for sway.\nI created a fork of sway called sway-regolith which adds the set_from_resource command. In order to communicate with the trawl demon, I used the wrapper functions provided by the libtrawldb library, which provides several wrapper functions for the DBus methods. Finally, I renamed the sway binary to sway-regolith in order to allow the fork and the upstream versions of sway to co-exist.\nRegolith-displayd In regolith, the de facto way for managing and changing settings is the use of gnome-control-center. Since the displays are managed by X11 in both i3 and Gnome on X11, the display panel of gnome-control-center works right out of the box. However, in the case of wayland based compositors and window managers like sway and mutter on wayland, the diplays are managed by the compositor itself. So gnome-control-center can manage displays only when mutter is the compositor in use.\nOn looking into gnome-control-center’s codebase, I discovered that the display settings are applied by communicating with the org.mutter.DisplayConfig DBus interface. So I created regolith-displayd, which creates a DBus interface with the same name. It primarily provides two DBus methods - GetCurrentState and ApplyMonitorsConfig. The GetCurrentState method gets the current configuration of monitors and maps it into a format understandable by gnome-control-center. Similarly, calls to the ApplyMonitorsConfig method applies the display settings changes made from gnome-control-center by mapping them into a format understandable by the IPC interface of sway.\nregolith-displayd also polls the sway IPC interface to check for changes in display configuration. If a change is detected, the MonitorsChanged signal is emmitted. gnome-control-center reacts to this message by making a call to GetCurrentState.\nIn order to achieve display configuration persistance, regolith-displayd generates kanshi profiles based on the displays that are currently in use. These configurations are then automatically applied whenever the same monitors are connected.\nRegolith-session regolith-session package is probably the most important part of regolith as it essentially ties i3 with GNOME flashback. This package is also partly responsible for the regolith-look related functionality. The code for wayland version of the package can be found in the wayland-dev branch.\nMigrating regolith-session to wayland required work on the following sections.\nSession initialization script (regolith-session-wayland) This script is responsible for loading the trawl resources set by the user, loading current look information, reformatting pango markup for workspace names, registering the session with gnome session manager and launching sway with the regolith configuration file.\n/usr/share/applications/regolith-wayland.desktop This application file executes the regolith-session-wayland script. This application file will be read by gnome-session-binary while loading the Required Components from the session file.\n/usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/regolith-wayland.session This file lists out the components required by the session in order to work correctly. If all the required components cannot be loaded, the session ends abruptly with an error. Most of these components are gnome-settings-daemon plugins. If the session is loaded using gnome-session --builtin, it launches the required components using their respective application files instead of launching their systemd services. The regolith-sway desktop file is also included in the required components section which launches ultimately starts the regolith session.\n/usr/share/wayland-sessions/regolith-sway.dektop This file is read by the display manager / login manager and shows the entry Regolith on Wayland in the login screen. The command /usr/bin/gnome-session --builtin --session=regolith-wayland is executed as soon as you login. This command looks for /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/regolith-wayland.session and loads the required components.\n/usr/lib/regolith/regolith-session-common.sh This provides functionality that is used in multiple scripts (related to both X11 and wayland based sessions). It also contains some variables that are required by many of the scripts related to regolith-session. I’ve added several functions and environment variables that are required to provide functionality equivalent to what is provided by Regolith on X11 sessions.\nRegolith look script (/usr/bin/regolith-look) This provides theming related functionallity, which is one of the defining features of the regolith ecosystem. I’ve added a check to determine if the current session type (X11 or Wayland). If the current session is wayland, trawlcat is used instead of xrescat and swaymsg reload is used instead of i3-msg refresh. When loading a look, if the current session is wayland, the configurations are loaded into trawl and if the session is X11, the resources are loaded using xrdb as XResources.\nRegolith Look The functionality of the regolith-look script (located at /usr/bin/regolith-look) has been discussed in the previous section. In order to apply the theme, a loader script is required. This can either be provided by the look or the user. If no loader is provided, the default loader script (present in the regolith-look-default package) is used. To make this loader script compatible with trawl in wayland, I had to check if the current session is wayland and set the RESOURCE_GETTER variable to trawlcat accordingly.\nRegolith also uses gnome-terminal by default. So in order to provide terminal theming in wayland, the regolith-init-term-profile script also needs to use trawlcat as resource getter. This script is responsible for changing the terminal profile theme.\nRegolith-inputd Similar to outut management, input management in wayland is also dependent on the compositor. This is the reason why changing input settings from gnome-control-center doesn’t work out of the box. In order to get the input panel of gnome-control-center to work, I created regolith-inputd, which monitors the gsettings schema org.gnome.desktop.peripherals. This allows to map changes in input properties to sway configuration commands which are then applied using the sway IPC interface.\nWhat’s next? You can track work related sway integration in this GitHub projects page. All contributions are more than welcome. I have really enjoyed working on this project and I plan to continue even after I’m done with the final evaluation for Google Summer of Code.\nWhat doesn’t work Lock Screen (Alternatives - swaylock) GNOME OSD overlays (Alternatives - wob) GNOME flashback / gnome-shell-related stuff Using any Display Manager other than GDM 3 causes issues swaybar status (requires several reloads to work properly) ilia keybindings page gnome-session-quit popup ","whats-next#What\u0026rsquo;s next?":""},"title":"Foundations for Regolith on Wayland (GSoC'22)"}}
